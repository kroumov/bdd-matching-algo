Hungarian Algorithm for Biomedical Data DesignThis Jupyter Notebook provides a practical implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm, a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time. This project is specifically tailored for a biomedical data design context, focusing on matching doctors to residency positions.What is the Assignment Problem?The assignment problem is a fundamental concept in combinatorial optimization. It seeks to find a one-to-one mapping between two sets of equal size (e.g., a set of doctors and a set of residency positions) to minimize the total cost or maximize the total value of the assignments.The Hungarian AlgorithmDeveloped by Harold Kuhn in 1955, the Hungarian algorithm is a powerful method for solving the assignment problem. It is known for its efficiency and guarantees finding an optimal solution. The algorithm works by iteratively finding a perfect matching in a bipartite graph with the maximum possible weight (or minimum cost).How to Use This NotebookOpen the Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the file hungarian_algorithm_biomed.ipynb.Run the Cells: Execute the cells in sequential order. The notebook is designed to be a step-by-step guide through the algorithm's implementation.Modify the Data: You can modify the input data (the cost matrix) to test the algorithm with different scenarios. The input data represents the "preferences" or "costs" of assigning doctors to specific residencies. A lower cost means a more desirable match.Interpret the Results: The final output of the notebook will be the optimal assignment of doctors to residencies and the total cost (or value) of this assignment.Key Components of the CodeBipartite Graph Representation: The problem is represented as a bipartite graph, with one set of vertices representing doctors and the other representing residencies. The edges between them contain weights corresponding to the cost of an assignment.Cost Matrix: The algorithm operates on a square cost matrix where each element C(i, j) represents the cost of assigning doctor i to residency j.Implementation: The notebook contains a Python implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm, which includes steps such as row reduction, column reduction, and finding the optimal solution through a series of augmenting paths.DependenciesThis notebook requires a standard Python environment with the following libraries:numpyscipy (for a pre-built implementation, if you choose to compare your manual implementation to a library solution)matplotlib (optional, for visualizing the data or results)You can install these dependencies using pip:pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
